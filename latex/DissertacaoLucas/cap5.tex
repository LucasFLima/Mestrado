The problem gets aggravated by
the fact that modern software applications are expected to
make use of these reusable modules as much as possible,
in an effort to reduce both the development costs and the
production time. Unfortunately, this situation opens the door
for the propagation of security vulnerabilities among several
applications as a result of the incorrect enforcement of security
properties in reusable software modules and threatens the
security and safety of applications as a whole.
